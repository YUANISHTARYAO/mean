# Mean of an array 
Write a program that asks the user to enter 5 numbers, and then prints the arithmetic mean of those numbers.

For example:

Enter 5 numbers:
number 1: 5
number 2: 3.14
number 3: 1.23
number 4: 100
number 5: 0.01

The mean of [5.00, 3.14, 1.23, 100.00, 0.01] is 21.88

# Bonus challenge
Do not use any built-in functions for calculating the mean. Instead code it up from scratch.

# Solution 
A sample solution is given in HW9_240401.py. 
The script can be run as follows: 
$ python3 HW9_240401.py
